Functional programming is a fundamentally different way of solving problems, and once It clicks, it's pure joy after that.
A lot of ideas in this library have been taken from Clojure and Haskell, so the credit goes to those languages. 
If you find your favorite function missing, or find ways to improve this project, I'd love to hear it.

There are quite a few functions in the library, And they can seem quite overwhelming at first.
These functions can be divided into four major categories-

#. Higher order functions. For example ``foldr``, ``curry``, ``flip``, 
#. Sequence traversing functions. For example ``first``, ``rest``, ``last``.
#. Sequence transforming functions. For example ``cons``, ``concat``, ``flatten``.
#. predicates. For example ``is_even``, ``is_prime``, ``is_nested``.
